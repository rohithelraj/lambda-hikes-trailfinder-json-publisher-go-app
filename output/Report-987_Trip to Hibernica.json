  "Description": "Mile after mile of serene pastures and rocky summits characterize\nthe east of the island, a remote region dotted with humble farming\nvillages. Many areas here are still relatively isolated, but they’re rich\nin rewards for those who make the journey. The almost inaccessible\nGolfo di Orosei coastline is riddled with secluded caves and coves –\nsome, such as Cala Luna, are reachable only by boat or on foot. And\nthe wild Gennargentu National Park is a haven for hikers, who might\ncatch sight of soaring golden eagles and nimble mouflon on its\ncraggy peaks.",
